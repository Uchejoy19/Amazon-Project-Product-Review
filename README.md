Project Overview
This project involved analyzing product and customer review data extracted from Amazon to derive actionable insights that could support decision-making in product strategy, pricing, marketing, and customer engagement. The dataset was provided as part of a data analytics case study by RetailTech Insights. It was completed as part of a training exercise for developing analytical skills in e-commerce intelligence and Excel-based dashboarding.

Project Scope and Objective
The objective was to assess patterns in customer reviews, pricing behavior, and product performance across various categories. Key goals included:

• Identifying top-performing products

• Understanding pricing and discount strategies

• Evaluating customer engagement metrics

• Building a dynamic, executive-friendly Excel dashboard

Dataset Overview
Source: Amazon product pages

Rows: 1,465 products

Columns: 16 fields including:

Product details: name, category, actual price, discounted price, rating

Customer engagement: review count, review titles and content

Ratings and discounts

Data Preparation
To ensure data integrity and avoid disrupting the original dataset:

• A separate working sheet was created for all analysis and transformations.

• Non-Essential columns (e.g., about_product, User_id, User_name, Review_id, review_title, review_content,img_link, product_link) were removed to streamline analysis.

• Data types were validated and cleaned for consistency across numerical and categorical fields.

• Extracted relevant values from comma-separated fields as needed for analysis.

Key Analysis Conducted
Using Excel Pivot Tables, formulas, and calculated columns, the following insights were extracted:

• Average Discount Percentage by Category: E.g., Computers & Accessories had an average discount of ~54%.

• Number of Products per Category: E.g., Electronics had the highest count with 526 products.

• Total Number of Reviews per Category: Electronics again led with over 15 million reviews.

• Top Rated Products: Identified using the highest average rating.

• Average Actual Price vs Discounted Price by Category: Calculated and compared.

• Most Reviewed Products: Ranked based on the number of user reviews.

• High Discount Products: Counted how many had ≥50% discounts.

• Product Rating Distribution: Grouped and visualized the rating spectrum (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, etc.).

• Total Potential Revenue by Category: Derived from Actual_Price × Rating_Count.

• Products by Price Range Buckets: Categorized into <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500.

• Rating vs Discount Correlation: Explored the relationship between higher discounts and customer ratings.

• Low Engagement Products: Flagged those with fewer than 1,000 reviews.

• Top Discount Categories: Identified categories with the largest average markdowns.

• Top 5 Products: Ranked based on a combined score of rating and review volume.
